## Introduction

dimLab is a collection of digital image processing pipelines. It uses:

<h4>napari:</h4> 

> **Multi-dimensional image viewer for python.**
> napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. It’s designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional images. It’s built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based rendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy). https://napari.org/stable/

<h4>cellpose:</h4> 

> a generalist algorithm for cellular segmentation https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose

<h4>pytorch:</h4>

> An open source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment.https://pytorch.org/ 

<h4>openCV:</h4>

> OpenCV is an open source computer vision and machine vision library, mainly for computer vision and computer vision applications. It is mainly used for image processing and computer vision. https://opencv.org/
