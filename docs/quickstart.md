# Quick Start

Welcome to dimLab! 

> [!Warning|style:flat] 
> Before you start remember this is a <code>dev</code> project, if you find a bug üêú please submit it to [GitHub](https://github.com/dale-lab/dimLab-Wiki/pulls)

> ü§ñüí≠ Lets start with the basics.

**dimLab**üì¶ is set to facilitate analysis of immunofluorescence data. To accomplish this we have set pipelines that take advantage of a collection of python projects that are exceptional in digital image processing and computer vision. [References](references.md "References")

> ü§ñüí≠ Before you start, you are going to need to install a couple of things:

## Git & GitHub
> <code>Git</code> is a free and open source distributed version control system. Git‚Äôs purpose is to keep track of projects and files as they change over time with manipulations happening from different users. Git stores information about the project‚Äôs progress on a repository. A repository has commits to the project or a set of references to the commits called heads. All this information is stored in the same folder as the project in a sub-folder called .git and will mostly be hidden by default in most systems.

> <code>GitHub</code> "is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It is a free service that provides a simple way to host and share code, manage projects, and build software".
> It can be seen as a cloud like Microsoft OneDrive, but it allows the programmers to share codes, search codes, download codes, and like codes. It is similar to what we do on Facebook, just the contents are different.

## CONDA
> <code>Conda</code> is an open source package and environment management system that runs on Windows, Mac OS and Linux. Conda can quickly install, run, and update packages and associated dependencies. Conda can create, save, load, and switch between project specific software environments on your local computer. Although Conda was created for Python programs, Conda can package and distribute software for any language such as R, Ruby, Lua, Scala, Java, JavaScript, C, C++, FORTRAN.

## VScode
> <code>IDEs</code> (Integrated Development Environment) are generally heavyweight, fully-featured code editors that include things like build/compiler setup, debuggers, code analysis tools, and more. Examples of IDEs include Eclipse, Visual Studio, and XCode.

## C++ Compilers
> <code>C++</code> It is a high-level language designed to be readable for you and other developers. The ++ comes from the C increment operator ++.

> If working with a <code>Windows machine</code>, please follow this guide to install the correct C++ compiler:
